### GAME RULES (to be updated)

**SCA** represents a gladiator battle inside an arena.

### Casual

**Goal**
Depends on the game mode.

**Champion selection**

1. Each player chooses a champion, chooses a color, takes the corresponding tokens, and builds a deck (or uses a pre-built one).

---

**Arena setup**

1. Place the champions in the arena.
2. Place the Environment card deck face up in the Future area.

---

**Ability selection**

1. Each player reveals their champion and places it face up on the table in front of them.
2. Place the Focus, Recovery, and Vitality dice next to the champion card.
   Set the Focus and Recovery dice to 0, and set the Vitality die to the Vitality value shown on the champion.
3. Give each player an Ability deck.
4. Starting with the white cards, players choose a number of cards equal to the value shown on their champion in the White box and place them face up, visible to the other players.
   Repeat the process for all the other colors.
   If during the process a player has a value of zero in a given color, they must wait until the other players have finished choosing their abilities.
   At any time during the process, other players may request a check to verify that the number of cards of a specific color matches the amount indicated on that player’s champion.
5. Once ability selection is complete, the remaining cards in the Ability deck are set aside, because they will no longer be available during the battle.
